## Introduction

In an era where data integrity and security are paramount, **Obibuf** provides a reliable solution for distributed systems that require stringent compliance and verification. Our protocol offers a streamlined approach to data marshalling, eliminating unnecessary overhead while ensuring that safety-critical applications maintain their integrity.

## Features

- **Zero-Overhead Protocol**: Efficient data handling without extra costs.
- **NASA Compliance**: Meets NASA-STD-8739.8 standards.
- **Cross-Language Support**: Compatible with multiple programming languages.
- **Formal Verification**: Ensures correctness through mathematical proof.
- **Zero Trust Security**: Protects data integrity with advanced security measures.

## Architecture

The architecture of **Obibuf** is designed with modularity in mind. Each component serves a specific function while maintaining a clear separation of concerns. This design not only enhances maintainability but also allows for easy integration into existing systems.

### Components

1. **Data Serializer**: Converts data into a format suitable for transmission.
2. **Data Deserializer**: Converts received data back into its original format.
3. **Verification Module**: Ensures data integrity and compliance.
4. **Security Layer**: Implements Zero Trust principles to safeguard data.

## Installation

To install **Obibuf**, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Zacharius338/obibuf.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd obibuf
   ```

3. Build the library:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

4. Install the library:
   ```bash
   sudo make install
   ```

## Usage

To use **Obibuf**, include the library in your project and follow the provided examples. Hereâ€™s a simple demonstration:

### Example

```c
#include <obibuf.h>

int main() {
    // Initialize the protocol
    obibuf_init();

    // Serialize data
    char* data = "Hello, World!";
    size_t size;
    void* serialized_data = obibuf_serialize(data, &size);

    // Transmit serialized data...

    // Deserialize data
    char* received_data = obibuf_deserialize(serialized_data, size);
    printf("Received: %s\n", received_data);

    // Cleanup
    obibuf_cleanup();
    return 0;
}
```

## Compliance

**Obibuf** adheres to the NASA-STD-8739.8 standard, which governs the development of software for safety-critical systems. This compliance ensures that our protocol meets rigorous safety and reliability requirements.

### Key Compliance Aspects

- **Documentation**: All processes and protocols are well-documented.
- **Testing**: Extensive testing is conducted to validate functionality.
- **Audit Trails**: Every change is tracked for accountability.

## Formal Verification

Formal verification is a crucial aspect of **Obibuf**. We utilize mathematical proofs to validate that our protocol behaves as intended under all conditions. This approach minimizes the risk of errors and enhances the reliability of safety-critical applications.

### Verification Process

1. **Modeling**: We create a formal model of the protocol.
2. **Proof Generation**: Using automated tools, we generate proofs of correctness.
3. **Validation**: We validate the proofs against the model to ensure accuracy.

## Zero Trust Architecture

In today's cybersecurity landscape, a Zero Trust approach is essential. **Obibuf** implements this architecture by assuming that threats could be both external and internal. 

### Key Principles

- **Least Privilege Access**: Users only have access to the data necessary for their role.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: All activities are monitored for suspicious behavior.
- **Verification of Identity**: Every access request is authenticated and authorized.
